PROBLEM
#########
One of my biggest goals currently is trying to find 
a method for sorting songs by similarity on a per song
basis rather than by album, artist, or genre.

The goal of this being to group the Million Song Dataset
in such a way that it can be accessed with reasonably given 
resources.

QUESTION
#########
1. What traits are the most important for determining, generally, how similar a song is?
2. What information does echonest actually give you? What does Valence mean for similarity?
3. What is Valence?
4. Are self-organizing maps the way to organize the final product? if not what is?

MORE TESTING REQUIRED
I believe my initial problem had too large a scope.
